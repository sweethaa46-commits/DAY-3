ANSWER:
a=input()

b=int(input())

c=int(input())

d=int(input())

e=int(input())

f=int(input())

total_marks=b+c+d+e+f

avg_marks=(total_marks)/5

print(f"Name of the Student:{a}")

print(f"Total Mark:{total_marks}")

print(f"Average Mark:{avg_marks}")

avg_marks=int(avg_marks)

if(avg_marks==100):

    print("Grade Mark:S")

elif(avg_marks>=90 and avg_marks<=99):

    print("Grade Mark:A")
